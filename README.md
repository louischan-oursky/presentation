# My presentation at Oursky

The presentation files are written according to the format documented at [https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/present](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/present). To render the presentation files, you need `present` installed locally on your machine.

If you have Go installed, then you can run the following command to install `present`.

```sh
make setup
```

Then you can just run `make start`, and open the printed URL in your browser.

```sh
make start
```
