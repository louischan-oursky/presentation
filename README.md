# My presentation at Oursky

The presentation files are written according to the format documented at [https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/present](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/present).

If you want to render them locally, you need to install a Go program called `present`.

```sh
go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present@latest
```

Then you can just run `present` at the project root, and open the printed URL in your browser.
